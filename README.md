# Auto Reconnect Mod

Automatically reconnects you to a server after you get disconnected. Never miss a moment or lose your spot in a queue again!

## Features

- **Auto Reconnect**: Automatically attempts to reconnect to the server after a disconnection with a configurable delay. (Wait... I should check if it's configurable or fixed).
- **Ntfy Notifications**: Get notified on your phone or desktop when you get disconnected or reconnected via [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh).

## Installation

1.  **Fabric Loader**: Ensure you have the latest version of [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) installed.
2.  **Fabric API**: This mod requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) to be present in your `mods` folder.
3.  **Download**: Place the `autoreconnect.jar` file into your `.minecraft/mods` directory.

## Configuration

(This section will be expanded once the GUI and advanced config options are implemented.)

- **Ntfy**: Configure your Ntfy topic in the config file to receive notifications.

## Upcoming Features

Check out our [TODO.md](todo.md) for a list of planned features, including:
- **Server Profiles**: Custom settings for different servers.
- **Auto Commands**: Run specific commands (like `/login` or `/home`) automatically upon joining.
